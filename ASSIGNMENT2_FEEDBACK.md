Hi Peter!

Awesome, well beyond what was required for assignment 2. Well done!

Välgodkänt! Congrats.

If you change the alerts to displaying on the page then you could use this for assigment 3. There is a bug when you click the same card twice that you'd need to solve, but other than that it's perfect.
